# Australiapp

I made Australiapp as a simple way to track my expenses while I'm studying abroad.
It provides a Node.js/Express REST API and a React frontend.

## Features
- User authentication and authorization
- Manage categories, currencies, budgets, and expenses
- Generate reports and visualizations
- Updated currency exchange rates using cron jobs with exchangerate API

## Deployment

The application is currently deployed at [australiapp.xyz](https://australiapp.xyz). Only my personal account is active, so resource usage is intentionally low. Want a quick demo? Reach out and Iâ€™ll show you around.

## Local Installation

### 1. Prerequisites
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and npm
- A running MySQL database

### 2. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Australiapp.git
cd Australiapp
```

### 3. Install dependencies
**Backend**
```bash
cd back
npm install
```

**Frontend**
```bash
cd front
npm install
```

### 4. Environment variables
Create a `.env` file inside the `back` directory:
```ini
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=3306
DB_USER=myuser
DB_PASS=mypassword
DB_NAME=mydatabase
```

### 5. Run the app
Start the backend in one terminal:
```bash
cd back
npm start
```

Start the frontend in another terminal:
```bash
cd front
npm run dev
```

The backend runs on http://localhost:3000 and the frontend on http://localhost:5173 by default.


NOTE: I added the functionality to add more users but commented it all because the website is only used by myself. If you wish to use the deployed version as well, contact me.
